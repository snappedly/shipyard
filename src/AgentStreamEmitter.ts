 * Emitted only in log-to-file mode when an `onAgentStreamEvent` callback is
 * provided via `logging`. See `run()`.
 *
 * The `"raw"` variant carries every stdout line the agent emits, verbatim and
 * before parsing — including lines that the provider's stream parser would
 * otherwise drop (e.g. tool-use blocks for unrecognised tools). Intended for
 * debugging when the typed `"text"` / `"toolCall"` events don't surface
